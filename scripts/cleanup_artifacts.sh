#
# Performs a cleanup operation across all Node.js projects within a monorepo. 
# It iteratively checks and removes `node_modules`, `package-lock.json`, `dist`, and `build` directories 
# from each project directory one level deep from the root. The script provides feedback on the presence 
# of these items before removing them, enhancing transparency.
#
# Instructions for use:
# 1. Place this script at the root of your monorepo.
# 2. Ensure the script is executable by running: chmod +x verbose_cleanup.sh
# 3. Execute the script by running: ./verbose_cleanup.sh
#
# Note: This script assumes a standard project structure with each Node.js project in its own subdirectory.
#

# Iterate over each subdirectory one level deep from the root
